# Angular 2 Starter

A simple Angular 2 starter project based on NPM, TypeScript, and Webpack.
Used to show how to set up a project build workflow from scratch.

To work on this project:

* Run `npm install` inside the project folder to download all the dependencies. This only needs to be done once.
* Run `npm run serve` to start a local development web server. You can now access the application at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
* Run `npm run build` to bundle everything into the `dist` folder for deployment; use `npm run build:prod` for a production build.

This example is part of the [Angular 2 From The Ground Up](http://www.encodedknowledge.com/coupons/angular2/github) course.
